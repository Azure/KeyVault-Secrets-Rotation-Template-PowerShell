# ###THIS IS TEMPLATE PROJECT FOR SECRET ROTATION FUNCTIONS. FOLLOW [THIS](https://github.com/Azure/KeyVault-Secrets-Rotation-Template-PowerShell) STEPS TO CREATE NEW SECRETS ROTATION FUNCTION PROJECT REPOSITORY###.

# KeyVault-Secrets-Rotation-[ServiceType]Key-PowerShell

Functions regenerate individual key (alternating between two keys) in [ServiceType] and add regenerated key to Key Vault as new version of the same secret.

## Features

This project framework provides the following features:

* Rotation function for [ServiceType] key triggered by Event Grid (AKV[ServiceType]Rotation)

* Rotation function for [ServiceType] key triggered by HTTP call (AKV[ServiceType]RotationHttp)

* ARM template for function deployment

* ARM template for adding storage account key to existing function

## Getting Started

Functions require following information stored in secret as tags:

* $secret.Tags["ValidityPeriodDays"] - number of days, it defines expiration date for new secret
* $secret.Tags["CredentialId"] - [ServiceType] credential id
* $secret.Tags["ProviderAddress"] - [ServiceType] Resource Id

You can create new secret with above tags and [ServiceType] key as value or add those tags to existing secret with [ServiceType] key. For automated rotation expiry date will also be required - key vault triggers 'SecretNearExpiry' event 30 days before expiry.

There are two available functions performing same rotation:

* AKV[ServiceType]Rotation - event triggered function, performs storage account key rotation triggered by Key Vault events. In this setup Near Expiry event is used which is published 30 days before expiration
* AKV[ServiceType]RotationHttp - on-demand function with KeyVaultName and Secret name as parameters

Functions are using Function App identity to access Key Vault and existing secret "CredentialId" tag with storage account key id (key1/key2) and "ProviderAddress" with Storage Account Resource Id.

### Installation

ARM templates available:

* Secrets rotation Azure Function and configuration deployment template - it creates and deploys function app and function code, creates necessary permissions, and Key Vault event subscription for Near Expiry Event for individual secret (secret name can be provided as parameter)
* Add event subscription to existing Azure Function deployment template - function can be used for multiple services for rotation. This template creates new event subscription for secret and necessary permissions to existing function.
